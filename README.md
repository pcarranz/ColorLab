RGB RFID Lamp 
========
San Luis Obispo Children's Museum Color Lab

This project contains Arduino code that controls an RFID reader module and an analog RGB LED strip. 

Purpose: Create an exhibit that will interactively teach children about light and the combinations of colors.

Functionality: The user shall be able to pick up a wooden disc with an embedded RFID tag and color scheme on it so that when 
placed near the RFID reader the LED strip will change to the combination the colors on the disc make. For example, if the disc
contains the colors red and blue the LED strip will change to magenta.

Color combinations supported:
  Red + Green = Magenta
  Blue + Green = Cyan
  Red + Green = Yellw
  Red + Green + Blue = White
  Wildcard = ROYGBIV
  Red, Blue, and Green
